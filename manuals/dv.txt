NAME
    dv

DESCRIPTION
    Find if there is direct variation between
    multiple x,y values. For example, given a
    table of x,y values, does each y value vary
    directly with its corresponding x value? If
    it does, the constant of variation (k) is
    returned. If it doesn't, a message saying
    there is no direct variation is printed.

INPUT SYNTAX
    - Enter the 'x' values first, hit enter, then
      enter the 'y' values all in the form of:
      (1,2,3)

ADDITIONAL INFO

      There can be unlimited x and y values.
      Important to note is that if the length of
      either set of values is greater than the
      other set, those additional values are
      ignored.

      Example:
      x = (1, 3)
      y = (2, 6, 9)

      Y varies directly with x because there is no
      x value that corresponds to the last y value,
      so the last y value is ignored.

      Also important to note is what the program
      does when it comes across a '0' in the list
      of 'x' values. Remember that any number
      divided by 0 is undefined. If any value in
      the 'x' list equals 0, the program immediately
      skips checking for direct variation and prints
      an error.
