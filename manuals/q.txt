NAME
    q -[flag]

DESCRIPTION
    Set up a quadratic equation using its a,b,c values. Use
    the flag to select what to do with the quadratic, such as
    factoring it, finding the vertex, etc.

    -f        Factors the quadratic equation into its simplest
              form: (x + n0)(x + n1)

    -d        Find the discriminant of the quadratic equation

    -v        Find the vertex of the quadratic equation

    -v fm     Similar to the -v flag, but return the quadratic
              equation in vertex form rather than just the
              vertex.

INPUT SYNTAX
    A prompt will ask for the a, b, and c values of the quadratic
    equation before any calculations are returned.
