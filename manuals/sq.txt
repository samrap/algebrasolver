NAME
    sq -[flag]

DESCRIPTION
    Check if the given sequence of numbers is a [flag] sequence.
    If it is, the common difference or ratio is printed. The flag
    specifies what type of series to look for.

    -a        Arithmetic sequence: The difference between
              consecutive terms is constant. If it is an
              arithmetic sequence, print the common difference

    -an       Arithmetic sequence + nth term: The difference
              between consecutive terms is constant. If it is an
              arithmetic sequence, print the specified nth term
              in addition to the common difference

    -g        Geometric sequence: The ratio of any term to its
              preceding term is constant. If it is a geometric
              sequence, print the common ratio

    -gn       Geometric sequence + nth term: The ratio of any
              term to its preceding term is constant. If it is a
              geometric sequence, print the specified nth term in
              addition to the common ratio

INPUT SYNTAX
    A prompt will ask for the sequence with each number separated
    by a comma ','. The sequence can optionally be wrapped in
    parenthesis i.e. (4,12,36) though it is not required. If the
    -n flag is specified, the desired nth term is required as
    input directly after the sequence is entered.
