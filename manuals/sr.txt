NAME
    sr -[flag]

DESCRIPTION
    Print the sum of the specified sequence. The flag specifies
    what type of series to find the sum of (i.e. arithmetic or
    geometric).

    Note that the command does not check if the input is a
    sequence, but assumes that it is. This is because the
    calculation does not require every value of the sequence, so
    there is no way to check for a common difference or ratio.
    This may seem like a poor feature at first, but is actually
    very useful; it allows you to find the sum (series) of a
    sequence where not all the data is provided. As long as a
    sequence can be assumed, the series can be calculated. The sq
    command can be used to determine if a list of data is a
    sequence, but only if all the data is known.

    Also note that this command does not work for the sum of any
    list of data. It must be a sequence. For finding the sum of
    a list of data that is not a sequence, a basic calculator
    will do the job.

    1 and only 1 argument must be used with this command.

    -a        Arithmetic series: Print the sum of the arithmetic
              sequence. The first term (a1), nth term (an), and
              the number of terms (n) are required as input.

    -g        Geometric series: Print the sum of the geometric
              series. The first term (a1), nth term (an), and the
              common ratio (r) are required as input.

INPUT SYNTAX
    Varies based on flag. Specifics are mentioned under the
    description of each flag above.
