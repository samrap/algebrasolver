NAME
    calc

DESCRIPTION
    Calculator mode. Once in calculator (calc) mode,
    you are able to use the command line as a basic
    calculator. This command function is the only
    current function that doesn't return to the main
    prompt once a calculation is finished. Instead,
    it remains in calc mode until the user exits it
    by entering '!' into the prompt.

    When calc mode has been entered, a message is
    printed saying that the user is now in calc
    mode. Once calc mode has been exited, a new
    message is printed saying that the user is
    back in default mode. To make the two modes
    look as unique as possible, the calc prompt
    looks like:

    calc >

    whereas the default prompt is:

    >>>

    This makes it easy to know what mode you are
    in at a quick glance.

INPUT SYNTAX
    Calc mode allows calculations of addition,
    subtraction, multiplication and division. As
    well as these basic operations, calc mode
    allows the use of parenthesis () to change
    the order of operations. If any invalid input
    is given, an error message prints and calc
    mode continues as if nothing happened. Note
    that no manuals, including this one are
    viewable in calc mode, you must exit calc
    mode and then view a manual.
